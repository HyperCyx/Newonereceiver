3. Click Continue

4. Wait 10-30 seconds

5. Check YOUR Telegram app for message:
   "Your login code is XXXXX"

6. Enter that code in the app

7. Success! ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPORTANT:
• OTP goes to the PHONE NUMBER you enter
• NOT to your admin Telegram account
• Use YOUR OWN number to see the OTP
• Or use a friend's number (with permission)
