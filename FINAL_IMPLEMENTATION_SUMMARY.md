## 🔧 Technical Details

### Phone Number Detection Algorithm
```javascript
Input: "+911234567890"
      ↓
Extract digits after +: "911234567890"
      ↓
Try 4-digit prefix: "9112" → Not found
Try 3-digit prefix: "911" → Not found
Try 2-digit prefix: "91" → Found! → IN
      ↓
Look up "IN" in database
      ↓
Found: India, Max: 200, Used: 50
      ↓
Check: 50 < 200 = True ✅
      ↓
Proceed with OTP
```
