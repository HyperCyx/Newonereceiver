## 🗄️ Database Schema

### country_capacity Table

```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- country_code: TEXT (unique, e.g., "US", "GB")
- country_name: TEXT (e.g., "United States")
- max_capacity: INTEGER (max accounts that can be purchased)
- used_capacity: INTEGER (accounts already purchased)
- prize_amount: DECIMAL (prize per account in USDT)
- is_active: BOOLEAN (whether country is accepting purchases)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### accounts Table (Updated)

```sql
- country_code: TEXT (links to country_capacity.country_code)
```

## 🔐 Security

- RLS policies implemented for country_capacity table
- Admins can view, create, update, and delete countries
- Public users can only view active countries
- Capacity reservation requires authentication

## 📡 API Reference

### Admin Endpoints

**GET /api/admin/countries**
- Lists all countries (admin only)

**POST /api/admin/countries**
- Actions: create, update, delete, reset_capacity
- Requires admin authentication

### Public Endpoints

**GET /api/countries**
- Lists all active countries with capacity info
- No authentication required

**POST /api/countries**
- Actions: check, reserve
- Check: No auth required
- Reserve: Requires authentication

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Run Migration

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /workspace

# Run migration script
npx tsx scripts/run-migration-008.ts

# Or manually execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy and paste contents of scripts/008_create_country_capacity_table.sql
```

### Step 2: Access Admin Panel

1. Visit your website: https://villiform-parker-perfunctorily.ngrok-free.dev
2. Login as admin
3. Click on "Countries" tab
4. Manage countries, capacities, and prizes

### Step 3: Sample Countries

The migration automatically creates these sample countries:
- 🇺🇸 United States - 100 capacity, $10.00 prize
- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom - 50 capacity, $8.00 prize
- 🇩🇪 Germany - 75 capacity, $9.00 prize
- 🇫🇷 France - 60 capacity, $8.50 prize
- 🇨🇦 Canada - 80 capacity, $9.50 prize
- 🇦🇺 Australia - 70 capacity, $9.00 prize

### Step 4: Integrate with Registration

Use the `CountrySelection` component in your registration flow:

```tsx
import CountrySelection from '@/components/country-selection'

// In your component
<CountrySelection 
  onCountrySelect={(country) => {
    // Handle country selection
    console.log('Selected:', country)
  }}
  showPrizes={true}
/>
```

## 📊 Admin Workflow

1. **Add a Country**
   - Go to Countries tab
   - Fill in: Code, Name, Capacity, Prize
   - Click "Add Country"

2. **Update Capacity**
   - Click on the capacity number
   - Enter new value
   - Tab out to save

3. **Update Prize**
   - Click on the prize amount
   - Enter new value
   - Tab out to save

4. **Toggle Status**
   - Click the Active/Inactive button
   - Instantly enables/disables country

5. **Reset Capacity**
   - Click "Reset" button
   - Confirms then resets used_capacity to 0

6. **Monitor Usage**
   - View progress bars
   - Check statistics cards
   - Red = full, Yellow = 80%+, Green = plenty

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Begin with lower capacity limits
   - Increase based on demand

2. **Monitor Regularly**
   - Check capacity usage daily
   - Plan ahead for popular countries

3. **Communicate Clearly**
   - Users see "No capacity" messages
   - Set reasonable expectations

4. **Prize Strategy**
   - Higher prizes for popular countries
   - Adjust based on conversion rates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue: Countries not showing**
- Check if countries are marked as `is_active = true`
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check RLS policies

**Issue: Capacity not updating**
- Ensure reserve API is called during purchase
- Check for database errors in logs
- Verify used_capacity is incrementing

**Issue: Admin can't manage countries**
- Confirm user has `is_admin = true`
- Check authentication token
- Review RLS policies

## 🎉 Success!

Your country capacity management system is now fully functional! Admins can:
- ✅ Control which countries can purchase accounts
- ✅ Set capacity limits per country
- ✅ Configure prize amounts
- ✅ Monitor usage in real-time
- ✅ Enable/disable countries as needed

Users will:
- ✅ See available countries with capacity info
- ✅ Know exactly how many accounts are available
- ✅ See prize amounts before purchasing
- ✅ Get clear "no capacity" messages

## 📚 Next Steps

1. Run the migration (if not already done)
2. Access the admin panel and test the Countries tab
3. Add/edit countries as needed
4. Integrate the CountrySelection component into your registration flow
5. Test the complete flow from user selection to capacity reservation
