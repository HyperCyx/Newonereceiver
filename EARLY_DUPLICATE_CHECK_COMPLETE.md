# ✅ EARLY DUPLICATE CHECK - BEFORE OTP

## 🎯 Feature Implemented

**User Request:**
> "Before sending the OTP, it will be checked whether the number has been sold before. If it has been sold, the OTP will not be sent."

**Solution:**
✅ Check database BEFORE sending OTP
✅ Reject immediately if number is taken
✅ Save time and resources - no wasted OTP
✅ Better user experience with instant feedback

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **OLD FLOW (Inefficient):** ❌
```
User enters phone number
  ↓
Send OTP ⏳ (wasted)
  ↓
User enters OTP ⏳ (wasted time)
  ↓
Check database
  ↓
❌ Error: "Number already sold"
```
**Problem:** Wasted time, wasted OTP, bad UX

### **NEW FLOW (Efficient):** ✅
```
User enters phone number
  ↓
✅ Check database FIRST
  ↓
If taken → ❌ STOP immediately with clear message
If available → ✅ Send OTP
```
**Benefit:** Instant feedback, no wasted resources!

### 1. **Database Check in Send-OTP Route** ✅

**File:** `/workspace/app/api/telegram/auth/send-otp/route.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
// Check if phone number already exists in database
const existingAccount = await db.collection('accounts').findOne({
  phone_number: phoneNumber
})

if (existingAccount) {
  // Case 1: Different user already owns this number
  if (existingAccount.user_id !== current_user_id) {
    return ❌ "Number already sold to another user"
  }
  
  // Case 2: Same user, already accepted
  if (existingAccount.status === 'accepted') {
    return ℹ️ "Already accepted! Check your Accepted tab"
  }
  
  // Case 3: Same user, rejected
  if (existingAccount.status === 'rejected') {
    return ❌ "Number was rejected, cannot resubmit"
  }
  
  // Case 4: Same user, pending - allow (they can retry)
  return ✅ "Send OTP"
}

// Case 5: Number not in database - allow
return ✅ "Send OTP"
```

### 2. **Pass Telegram ID to Send-OTP** ✅

**File:** `/workspace/components/login-page.tsx`

  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    phoneNumber,
    telegramId  // ← NEW: For duplicate check
  })
})
```
