## üîç **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Admin Telegram ID not found"

**Cause:** The app couldn't get your Telegram ID

**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Restart the Telegram app
3. Check if you're opening via Telegram (not browser)

**Check in console:**
```javascript
// At the top of console, you should see:
const tg = window.Telegram?.WebApp
console.log('User ID:', tg.initDataUnsafe?.user?.id)
// Should show: User ID: 1211362365
```

---

### Issue 2: "Unauthorized" Error

**Cause:** Your Telegram ID is not recognized as admin

**Solution:**
1. Check database: User 1211362365 should have `is_admin: true`
2. Run admin setup script:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/set-admin.ts
```

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/check-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"telegramId": 1211362365}'
# Should return: {"isAdmin": true}
```

---

### Issue 3: Nothing Happens (No Error)

**Cause:** Button click not registered or JS error

**Check console for:**
- Red error messages
- Any JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed requests

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear cache
3. Restart Telegram app

---

### Issue 4: API Call Succeeds but Page Doesn't Refresh

**Cause:** `fetchAllData()` not working

**Check console:**
```
[Delete] Response: 200 {success: true}
// Should be followed by data refetch logs
```

**Solution:**
1. The page should refresh automatically
2. If not, manually refresh
3. Check if countries list updates

---

## üìã **Debugging Checklist**

Run these in browser console when on admin page:

### Check 1: Telegram WebApp Available?
```javascript
console.log('Telegram WebApp:', window.Telegram?.WebApp)
// Should show object, not undefined
```

### Check 2: User ID Available?
```javascript
const tg = window.Telegram?.WebApp
console.log('User ID:', tg.initDataUnsafe?.user?.id)
// Should show: 1211362365
```

### Check 3: Admin Telegram ID in State?
```javascript
// Look for this in console when page loads:
// "Admin Telegram ID: 1211362365"
```

### Check 4: Countries Loaded?
```javascript
// You should see countries in the table
// If not, check console for fetch errors
```

### Check 5: Test API Directly
```bash
# In terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/countries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"delete","countryId":"COUNTRY_ID_HERE","telegramId":1211362365}'
```
