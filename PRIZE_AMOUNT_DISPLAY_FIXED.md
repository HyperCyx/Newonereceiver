# ✅ PRIZE AMOUNT DISPLAY NEXT TO TIMER - FIXED

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**User Request:** 
> "The prize that the admin has set for the country in the admin panel will be given to the user's account when the number is confirmed. And how much money is being paid for that number - It will show next to the timer, how much the number was sold for."

**Solution:** 
✅ Prize amount now displays next to the timer for pending accounts
✅ Enhanced logging to show exactly what prize is set when account is created
✅ Clear visibility of prize amount throughout the account lifecycle

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Display Prize Amount Next to Timer** ✅

**File:** `/workspace/components/transaction-list.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
<p className="text-[12px] text-blue-600 mt-1 font-medium">
  ⏱️ Auto-approve in: {getTimeRemaining(transaction)}
</p>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<p className="text-[12px] text-blue-600 mt-1 font-medium">
  ⏱️ Auto-approve in: {getTimeRemaining(transaction)} | 💰 Prize: ${transaction.amount} USDT
</p>
```

**Result:** Users can now see how much the number will be sold for right next to the timer!

### 2. **Enhanced Logging When Account Created** ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `/workspace/app/api/telegram/auth/verify-otp/route.ts`
- `/workspace/app/api/telegram/auth/verify-2fa/route.ts`

**Enhanced Country Detection Logging:**
```typescript
console.log(`[VerifyOTP] 🔍 Detecting country for ${phoneNumber} (digits: ${phoneDigits})`)
console.log(`[VerifyOTP] Trying country code: ${possibleCode}`)
console.log(`[VerifyOTP] ✅ Country found: ${country.country_name}, Code: ${possibleCode}, Prize: $${prizeAmount}`)
console.log(`[VerifyOTP] ⚠️ No country found or prize is $0 for ${phoneNumber}`)
```

**Enhanced Account Creation Logging:**
```typescript
console.log(`[VerifyOTP] 💰 Account created: ${phoneNumber} | Status: PENDING | Prize: $${prizeAmount} USDT (${countryName})`)
```

**Result:** Clear logs show exactly what prize amount was set when the account was created!

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### When User Submits a Phone Number:

1. **Country Detection:**
   - System extracts digits from phone number
   - Tries to match country code (1-4 digits)
   - Looks up country in `country_capacity` collection
   - Gets `prize_amount` from matched country

2. **Account Creation:**
   - Account created with status: `pending`
   - Account created with `amount`: Prize from country settings
   - Logs show: "Account created: +1234567890 | Status: PENDING | Prize: $5.00 USDT (United States)"

3. **Display in Pending List:**
   - Phone number shown
   - Amount shown: "$5.00 USDT"
   - Timer shown: "⏱️ Auto-approve in: 5h 30m | 💰 Prize: $5.00 USDT"

4. **When Admin Approves OR Auto-Approves:**
   - Prize amount ($5.00) is added to user's balance
   - Account status changes to: `accepted`
   - Account moves to "Accepted" tab

## 🔍 Debugging Prize Amounts

### If Prize Shows $0.00:

**Check the logs for:**
```
⚠️ No country found or prize is $0 for +[phone]
```

**This means:**
1. The country code hasn't been added to Country Management
2. OR the country exists but `prize_amount` is set to $0

**To Fix:**
1. Go to Admin Panel → Country Management
2. Add the country code (e.g., "1" for USA, "44" for UK)
3. Set the prize amount (e.g., $5.00)
4. Save
5. Future accounts from this country will show correct prize

## 🌐 How Admin Sets Prize Amounts

### In Admin Panel → Country Management:

1. **Add New Country:**
   - Country Code: `1` (USA)
   - Country Name: `United States`
   - Prize Amount: `5.00`
   - Max Capacity: `100`
   - Auto-Approve Minutes: `360` (6 hours)

2. **Save Country**

3. **Result:**
   - All phone numbers starting with `+1` will get $5.00 prize
   - Shows in pending list: "💰 Prize: $5.00 USDT"
   - When approved, $5.00 added to user balance
