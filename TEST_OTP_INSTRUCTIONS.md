# How to Test OTP Functionality

## üîç I've Enhanced the OTP System with Detailed Logging

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Backend Logging**
   - Added step-by-step logs in `lib/telegram/auth.ts`
   - Shows connection status, code type, and errors
   - Better error messages for common issues

2. **Enhanced Frontend Logging**
   - Added console logs in `components/login-page.tsx`
   - Shows request details and responses
   - User gets popup notification when code is sent

3. **Better User Feedback**
   - Shows what type of code (SMS, call, flash call, app)
   - Displays success popup when code is sent
   - Clear error messages

## üîß Direct API Test

Test the API directly without frontend:

```bash
# Replace with your phone number
curl -X POST https://villiform-parker-perfunctorily.ngrok-free.dev/api/telegram/auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber":"+1234567890","countryCode":"1"}'
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "phoneCodeHash": "abc123...",
  "sessionString": "session...",
  "codeType": "sentCodeTypeSms",
  "message": "OTP sent successfully via SMS. Check your Telegram app."
}
```

## üìä Server-Side Logs

Check server logs for detailed backend info:

```bash
tail -50 /tmp/dev-server.log | grep -E "SendOTP|TelegramAuth"
