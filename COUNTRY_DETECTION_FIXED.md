# ✅ COUNTRY DETECTION & PRIZE DISPLAY FIXED

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Prize Not Showing for +998 (Uzbekistan)** ✅
**Problem:** Phone number +998701470983 was showing $0.00 USDT instead of $2.00
**Root Cause:** Database stores country codes with "+" prefix ("+998"), but detection code was looking for "998" without the "+"
**Solution:** Updated all country detection logic to check both formats

### 2. **Duplicate Prize Display** ✅
**Problem:** Prize amount was shown twice - once above and once in timer line
**Solution:** Removed duplicate, prize now only shows once above the timer

### 3. **Verbose Timer Text** ✅
**Problem:** Timer showed "⏱️ Auto-approve in: 37s | 💰 Prize: $0.00 USDT"
**Solution:** Simplified to just "⏱️ 37s"
