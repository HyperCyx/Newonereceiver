## üîç Common Issues & Instant Fixes

```

- Or restart Telegram app

### Issue 2: "Country not found"

**You see:**
```
[Delete] Response: 404 {error: "Country not found"}
```

2. List will update
3. Try with a different country

### Issue 3: "Unauthorized"

## üß™ Quick Test (Do This First!)

### Test in Terminal:

```bash
# 1. Get country IDs
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/admin/countries | grep "_id"

# 2. Copy one ID, then test:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/countries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"delete","countryId":"PASTE_ID_HERE","telegramId":1211362365}'
```

**If this works** ‚Üí Frontend issue  
**If this fails** ‚Üí API/database issue

## üéØ Most Likely Solution

### The country was already deleted!

**Scenario:**
1. You clicked Delete
2. API deleted it successfully  
3. But page didn't refresh properly
4. You clicked Delete again on same (now deleted) country
5. Gets "Country not found" error

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
- Countries list will update
- Try delete on a different country

## üìù What to Tell Me

1. **What browser console shows:**
```
[Delete] ...
[Delete] ...
```

2. **What alert message says:**
```
‚úÖ Success message?
OR
‚ùå Error message?
```

3. **Does the country actually get deleted?**

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/check-admin \
