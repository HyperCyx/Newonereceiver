│  User wants to verify/sell Telegram account            │
│  Phone number: +923001234567                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User enters that phone number in your app              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your system calls Telegram API:                        │
│  "Send OTP to +923001234567"                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Telegram sends OTP to +923001234567                    │
│  (The account being verified)                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OTP arrives on the phone with number +923001234567     │
│  In THAT person's Telegram app                          │
│  NOT in YOUR Telegram app                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User sees the OTP code                                 │
│  Enters it in your app                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your system verifies the OTP                           │
│  User proves they own that account                      │
│  Account gets verified ✅                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
