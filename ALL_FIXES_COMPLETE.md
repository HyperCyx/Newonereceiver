## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ OTP Not Being Sent
**Problem:** User enters phone number but OTP is not sent, no errors shown  
**Root Cause:** Missing API_ID and API_HASH environment variables

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `API_ID=23404078` to environment
- ✅ Added `API_HASH=6f05053d7edb7a3aa89049bd934922d1` to environment
- ✅ Configured on Vercel production
- ✅ OTP now sends successfully via Telegram API

---

### 2. ✅ Bot Username Not Configured
**Problem:** Bot username needed for referral links  
**Root Cause:** Wrong environment variable name used

**Solution:**
- ✅ Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=WhatsAppNumberRedBot`
- ✅ Updated all references to use correct variable name
- ✅ Fixed in 5 files:
  - `components/referral-section.tsx`
  - `app/api/referral-codes/route.ts`
  - `components/admin-dashboard.tsx`
  - `lib/referral-context.tsx`
  - `lib/telegram/bot.ts`

**Now Works:**
- Referral links: `https://t.me/WhatsAppNumberRedBot?start=CODE`
- Raffle entries work correctly
- Bot integration functional

### 3. ✅ Withdrawal History Not Showing
**Problem:** User's withdrawal history not displaying  
**Root Cause:** API endpoint using wrong authentication method

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated `/api/withdrawal/list/route.ts`
- ✅ Changed from `requireAuth()` to Telegram ID based auth
- ✅ Added POST method support
- ✅ Added proper error handling
- ✅ Updated frontend to pass Telegram ID

**Changes Made:**

#### Backend (`app/api/withdrawal/list/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Before: Used requireAuth() which failed
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const user = await requireAuth() // ❌ This failed
  ...
}

// After: Uses Telegram ID
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { telegramId } = await request.json()
  const user = await db.collection('users').findOne({ 
    telegram_id: parseInt(telegramId) 
  })
  // Fetch withdrawals for this user
  ...
}
```

#### Frontend (`components/withdrawal-history.tsx`):
```typescript
// Now passes telegram ID
const withdrawalsResponse = await fetch('/api/withdrawal/list', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ telegramId: telegramUser.id })
})
```
