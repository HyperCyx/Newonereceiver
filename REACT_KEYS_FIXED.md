## Issue Resolved

**Error:** "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop"

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Users Table
- ✅ Added `key="loading"` to loading state
- ✅ Added `key="no-users"` to empty state
- ✅ Changed `key={user.id}` to `key={user._id}` for MongoDB

### 2. Transactions Table
- ✅ Added `key="loading-transactions"` to loading state
- ✅ Added `key="no-transactions"` to empty state
- ✅ Existing items already had `key={tx.id}`

### 3. Referral Codes Table
- ✅ Added `key="loading-referrals"` to loading state
- ✅ Added `key="no-referrals"` to empty state
- ✅ Changed `key={code.id}` to `key={code._id}` for MongoDB

### 4. Payment Requests Table
- ✅ Added `key="loading-requests"` to loading state
- ✅ Added `key="no-requests"` to empty state
- ✅ Existing items already had proper keys

### 5. Countries Table
- ✅ Added `key="loading-countries"` to loading state
- ✅ Added `key="no-countries"` to empty state
- ✅ Changed `key={country.id}` to `key={country._id}` for MongoDB
- ✅ Fixed all `countryId: country.id` to `countryId: country._id`

## MongoDB ID Changes

Since we migrated from Supabase to MongoDB, all references to `.id` needed to be changed to `._id`:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `user.id` | `user._id` |
| `code.id` | `code._id` |
| `country.id` | `country._id` |
| `countryId: country.id` | `countryId: country._id` |

---

## Files Modified

**Components:**
- ✅ `/workspace/components/admin-dashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added keys to all loading states
- Added keys to all empty states
- Updated all MongoDB ID references from `.id` to `._id`
- Fixed country operations to use `._id`

---

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
⚠️ Console Error: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop
⚠️ Warning appeared for multiple tables
```

### After Fix
```
✅ No React warnings
✅ All lists have proper keys
✅ MongoDB IDs correctly referenced
```

---

## React Best Practices Applied

### ✅ Loading States
```tsx
{loading ? (
  <tr key="loading">
    <td>Loading...</td>
  </tr>
) : ...}
```

### ✅ Empty States
```tsx
{items.length === 0 ? (
  <tr key="no-items">
    <td>No items found</td>
  </tr>
) : ...}
```

### ✅ Mapped Items
```tsx
{items.map((item) => (
  <tr key={item._id}>
    <td>{item.name}</td>
  </tr>
))}
```

## All Admin Dashboard Tables Fixed

| Table | Loading Key | Empty Key | Item Key |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Users | ✅ `loading` | ✅ `no-users` | ✅ `user._id` |

| Countries | ✅ `loading-countries` | ✅ `no-countries` | ✅ `country._id` |
