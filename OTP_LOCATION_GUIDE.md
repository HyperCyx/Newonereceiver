# ✅ OTP IS WORKING - It's in Your Telegram App!

## 🎯 THE ISSUE WAS FOUND!

### What's Happening:
```
Type: SentCodeType.APP
```

**The OTP is sent INSIDE the Telegram app, NOT via SMS!**

## 📱 Where to Find Your OTP Code

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open Telegram App** (on your phone or computer)
   - Can be mobile app
   - Can be desktop app  
   - Can be web.telegram.org

2. **Look for "Telegram" Chat**
   - It's the official Telegram account
   - Has a blue checkmark ✓
   - Usually at the top of your chat list

3. **Open That Chat**
   - You'll see a message like:
   ```
   Your login code is: 12345
   
   Do not share this code with anyone.
   ```

4. **Copy the Code**
   - The 5-digit code in that message
   - Enter it in the OTP field on the website

## 🔍 Why This Happens

When your phone number is **already registered on Telegram**, Telegram sends login codes through the app instead of SMS because:

✅ **More Secure** - Code stays within Telegram's encrypted system  
✅ **Faster** - Instant delivery  
✅ **More Reliable** - No SMS delivery issues  
✅ **Cheaper** - No SMS costs  

## 📊 OTP Sending Types

| Type | Where Code Arrives | When Used |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| `SentCodeType.APP` | **Inside Telegram app** | Phone has active Telegram account |
| `SentCodeType.SMS` | **Via SMS text message** | New number or app not installed |
| `SentCodeType.CALL` | **Voice call** | Backup method |

**Your case:** `SentCodeType.APP` ← Code is in Telegram app!

## ✅ Verification

I tested with your number:
```
Phone: +998909999999
Result: Success ✅
Type: SentCodeType.APP
Hash: 2b1beb5cf13ceb5658

→ OTP sent to Telegram app successfully!
```

## 🎯 What to Do Now

1. **Open Telegram App**
2. **Find "Telegram" official chat**
3. **Check for login code message**
4. **Enter the 5-digit code on website**
5. **Done!**

## 🔄 If You Still Don't See It

### Check 1: Right Telegram Account
- Make sure you're logged into Telegram with phone number +998XXXXXXXXX
- If you have multiple Telegram accounts, check the right one

### Check 2: Archived Chats
- The message might be in "Archived Chats"
- Swipe down on chat list to see archived

### Check 3: Notifications
- Check notification center on your phone
- Telegram might have sent a notification

### Check 4: Desktop vs Mobile
- If using desktop Telegram, check there
- If using mobile, check there
- Code arrives on ALL logged-in devices

## 📝 For Different Phone Numbers

To get OTP via SMS instead of app:
1. Use a phone number that's NOT registered on Telegram
