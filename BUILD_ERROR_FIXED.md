# ✅ BUILD ERROR FIXED - ADMIN PANEL WORKING

## 🐛 The Error

```
Parsing ecmascript source code failed
Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
Unterminated regexp literal
```

**Location:** `/workspace/components/admin-dashboard.tsx` line 819 & 2124

## 🔧 The Fix

**Problem:** Duplicate opening div tag without proper closing

**In the Recent Transactions section:**

**Before (Broken):**
```tsx
<div className="p-5">
<div className="space-y-2">  ← Two opening divs
  {/* content */}
</div>
</div>  ← Only one closing, missing second
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
<div className="p-5">
  <div className="space-y-2">  ← Properly nested
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</div>  ← Both properly closed
```

**Solution:** Fixed the JSX structure to properly nest and close all div elements.
