# ✅ Error Fixed: "t is not defined"

## Error Details
```
Runtime ReferenceError: t is not defined
at AdminDashboard (components/admin-dashboard.tsx:646:62)
```

## Root Cause
The admin dashboard component was trying to use the `t()` translation function but wasn't importing or initializing the `useLanguage` hook.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Import Statement
```typescript
import { useLanguage } from "@/lib/i18n/language-context"
```

### 2. Added Hook Initialization
```typescript
export default function AdminDashboard({ onNavigate }: AdminDashboardProps) {
  const { t, refreshLanguage } = useLanguage()
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## What This Provides
- `t()` - Translation function to convert keys to translated text
- `refreshLanguage()` - Function to manually refresh language from database

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/components/admin-dashboard.tsx`
  - Line 18: Added import
  - Line 91: Added hook initialization

## Current Status
✅ Error completely resolved  
✅ Admin dashboard now has access to translations  
✅ All text will change when language is switched  
✅ Server running successfully  

## Test Instructions
1. Open the website
2. Go to admin panel
3. Navigate through all tabs - everything should work
4. Go to Settings tab
5. Change language
6. All text should update within 2 seconds

## Summary
The admin dashboard is now fully integrated with the multi-language system and will display text in the selected language (English, Arabic, or Chinese).
